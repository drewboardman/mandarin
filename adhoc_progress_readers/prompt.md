You are a professional language educator and writer. Your task is to write a short Chinese graded reader story designed to reinforce newly learned vocabulary.

## Objectives:

1. Write a single short story in **Simplified Chinese** of approximately **3,000 to 5,000 characters**.
2. Use **every word** from the "NEW WORDS" list **at least twice** (if possible) in the story.
3. You may freely use any words from the "KNOWN WORDS" list as supporting vocabulary.
4. Do **not** use any words that are **not in the NEW WORDS or KNOWN WORDS** lists unless they are:
   - Common proper nouns (e.g. names like 小明, 小红)
   - Numbers or dates
   - Basic particles and function words (的, 是, 了, 在, etc.)

## Writing Style:

- The story should be written for a motivated adult learner. I am a male who tends to be interested in typical male themes.
- You may use **natural, age-appropriate themes**: mystery, romance, adventure, workplace conflict, etc.
- The tone can be smart, witty, or suspenseful—but still **simple in grammar**.
- Prefer short to medium-length sentences.
- Repeat key vocabulary naturally throughout the story.

## Difficulty

Here is an example reader from another word set. Use this as a framework to adjust the difficulty to attempt to match this beginner level:

>“你太小氣了！”大頭天天對歡歡很不好。
>“這是什麽書？我要看一下！”大頭說。
>“不，你不要過來，你不要過來。我要叫老師了！”歡歡生氣地大叫。”

## Format:

- Only output the story. No explanations, no titles, no lists, no formatting.
- Do not include Pinyin or definitions.
- The story should be **readable and coherent** on its own.

## Vocabulary:

### NEW WORDS (use all of these, attempt to use them at least twice each):

[Paste your ~80–85 new words here]

### KNOWN WORDS (these are always allowed):

[Paste your current known words list here]
