# 🧠 Chinese Study Background & Plan

I'm a beginner Mandarin learner (~6 weeks in) with ~1,400 known words, studying 7 days a week with no missed days. This is my **first language** outside English. I'm using **Anki with FSRS** (90–91% retention) and add **36 new cards per day**, resulting in ~300 daily reviews. I focus entirely on **input only** (reading + listening), not output.

I use **HyperTTS audio on card flips** to reinforce sound, and I've started **reading 1 hour every morning** before Anki. My current reading pace is:
- 1 **Breakthrough Mandarin Companion** reader per week
- Or ½ of a **Level 1 Mandarin Companion** reader per week

I do **comprehensible input (CI) listening** as bonus time when available.

## 📚 Vocab Mining Process

I pre-mine vocab before every reading session. My mining process includes:

### 🔹 Disney Dreamlight Valley Project
- I dumped and parsed **every Chinese line** from all the game’s localization files.
- I built a word table using:
  - **BTLX corpus**
  - **SUBTLEX word + character frequency tables**
  - **CC-CEDICT**
  - **Jieba** tokenizer
- I cross-referenced all Disney words with this frequency corpus to rank them.
- The table has ~17,000 words (some are junk).
- I query the top unknown words, log them via `queried_on`, and filter with AI.
- I have AI remove "junk words" such as:
  - Possessives (e.g. 我的)
  - 不 + verb combos (e.g. 不要)
  - Overly decomposed collocations (e.g. only half of a phrase)

My goal is to eventually know the **most frequent Disney words** and **play the game** once I reach ~4,500–5,000 known words from that list (ETA: ~mid-September).

## 🗓 Ongoing Study Plan

- **36 new Anki cards/day** (~250/week)
- Vocabulary is mined from:
  - **Disney Dreamlight Valley** frequency-ranked list
  - **Mandarin Companion** word lists (pre-mined before each book)
  - **Corpus-based frequency list**
- **Morning reading habit**: 1 hour per day
- Ask AI to explain difficult sentences/phrases
- **Leech cards**:
  - I don’t delete them
  - I review them manually
  - I sometimes batch ~50 difficult words and ask AI to create a custom **beginner-level reader** for context exposure

## 🧳 Long-Term Goals

- **2,900 words in 6 weeks**
- **4,500+ words by mid-September** (Disney goal)
- **10,000–12,000+ words by 1-year mark**
- Considering a **4-week trip to China in December**
  - Goal: cultural immersion and real-world reading/listening practice
  - Still maintaining **zero output** plan for now (no speaking or writing)
